# ScienceBlog

Project deployed [here!](https://science-blog-db452.firebaseapp.com/)

## Description

My second angular8 project using firebase realtime database. This app has user functionality where users can create or comment science posts. Every user has control over his posts - which means Create / Read / Update / Destroy and can only read the other's users posts. All logged users can comment on posts and also delete them. The app is secured in client side and also in server side with firebase rules using authentication tokens.
